{"name":"GROMACS Tutorials","tagline":"Some GROMACS tutorials using methane and water","body":"#GROMACS Tutorials\r\n\r\nSome [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org) tutorials for beginners. It's not\r\nnecessary to do the tutorials in order, but the first two\r\ntutorials are essential before going on to the others, as the structure file\r\n(`methane.pdb`) and topology file (`topol.top`) for methane from tutorial 2 are\r\nused in all subsequent tutorials.\r\n\r\nI assume you have some working knowledge of the command line. Specifically, you\r\nshould know how to make directories, change into them, and edit text files.\r\nObviously I also assume you have GROMACS installed on a machine available to you.\r\n\r\nThroughout the tutorials we'll be using OPLS methane and TIP4PEW water.\r\n\r\n##Contents\r\n\r\n1. [Water](1_tip4pew_water/README.md) - Basics of setting up a simulation. Find out the\r\n   density of TIP4PEW water.\r\n2. [One methane in water](2_methane_in_water/README.md) - How to create a topology file\r\n   for a molecule and solvate it. Get the radial distribution function.\r\n3. [Several methanes in water](3_methanes_in_water/README.md) - How to put multiple\r\n   solutes into a system. Get the methane-methane potential of mean force.\r\n4. [Free energy of solvation of methane](4_methane_fe/README.md) - How to do a free energy\r\n   simulation when coupling a molecule. Use MBAR to get the result.\r\n5. [Umbrella sampling](5_umbrella/README.md) - Get methane-methane PMF from umbrella sampling using pull\r\n   code.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\nSome of the other software that I use in these tutorials that you may find\r\nuseful are:\r\n\r\n* [alchemical-analysis](https://github.com/MobleyLab/alchemical-analysis)\r\n* [Avogadro](http://avogadro.cc/wiki/Main_Page)\r\n* [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)\r\n* [vmd](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-66330449-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
